			<h1>Stone Sour - <small>'82</small></h1>
			<p>Oh long ago<br />
		There was a dead rat caught in a Chinese trap<br />
		And all I had to show<br />
		Were the ashes of a life that had no chance<br />
		It wasn't right, but all I could do<br />
		Was be another number that couldn't refuse<br />
		What a lie, with nothing to lose<br />
		Something happened in 1982!<br />
		<br />
		Are you the enemy?<br />
		Let me show you what you did to me<br />
		<br />
		Once I get away from here<br />
		I know it's going be my time<br />
		I've seen too much to keep me here<br />
		I don't want yours I just want mine<br />
		<br />
		I'm never alone...<br />
		I'm always in the middle talking to myself<br />
		And all I want to know<br />
		Am I really on the road? I just can't tell<br />
		It isn't right<br />
		But all I can do is take it to a level where I can't refuse<br />
		It's a lie-<br />
		I need you to see<br />
		Let me show you what you did to me<br />
		<br />
		Once I get away from here<br />
		I know it's going be my time<br />
		I've seen too much to keep me here<br />
		I don't want yours I just want mine<br />
		Before I get away from here<br />
		I think I better set you straight<br />
		I know my place is miles from here<br />
		You'll never understand- I make my fate<br />
		<br />
		Deep down there's a Devil inside<br />
		He can make you give up everything<br />
		Settle if you want to die<br />
		Or you can live for a world that must be free<br />
		<br />
		Oh once I get away from here<br />
		I know it's doing be my time<br />
		I've seen too much to keep me here<br />
		I don't want yours, I just want mine<br />
		Before I get away from here<br />
		I think I better set you straight<br />
		I know my place is miles from here<br />
		You'll never understand-I make my fate<br />
		Once I get away from here<br />
		Oh once I get away from here-<br />
		I know it's going be my time!
