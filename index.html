			<h1>Stone Sour <small>'82</small></h1>
			<p>Oh long ago<br />
		There was a dead rat caught in a Chinese trap<br />
		And all I had to show<br />
		Were the ashes of a life that had no chance<br />
		It wasn't right, but all I could do<br />
		Was be another number that couldn't refuse<br />
		What a lie, with nothing to lose<br />
		Something happened in 1982!<br />
		<br />
		Are you the enemy?<br />
		Let me show you what you did to me<br />
		<br />
		Once I get away from here<br />
		I know it's going be my time<br />
		I've seen too much to keep me here<br />
		I don't want yours I just want mine<br />
		</p>
